## Releases

ðŸ“¦ **Binaries** can be downloaded from SourceForge: **[Comic Strip Browser Files](https://sourceforge.net/projects/comic-strip-browser/files/releases/)**.

## Installation

### Pre-built Binaries

- **Linux**: 
	- `.deb` package for Debian/Ubuntu/Mint
	- Prebuilt binary with `.desktop` file and icon
	- AppImage (just in case)

### Linux Installation

#### Using the .deb package (Debian/Ubuntu):
```bash
sudo apt install ./comic-strip-browser*.deb
```

Alternatively, GDebi, Captain (Mint) or Discover can be used.

#### Using the prebuilt binary:

With `comic-strip-browser`, `comic-strip-browser.desktop`, `comic-strip-browser.png` and `install.sh` in the same folder, make sure the last one is executable (`chmod +x install.sh`) and launch it. It will install to `~/.local/bin/`.

To uninstall the app, launch `~/.local/bin/uninstall-comic-strip-browser`.

#### Using the AppImage:
```bash
chmod +x Comic_Strip_Browser-x86_64.AppImage
./Comic_Strip_Browser-x86_64.AppImage
```

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites:
```bash
# For Debian/Ubuntu/Mint
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential python3 python3-pip

# For Fedora
sudo dnf install -y @development-tools python3 python3-pip

# For Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S base-devel python python-pip
```

### Build the binary:
```bash
./build_scripts/build_linux.sh
```

Alternatively:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python ./build_scripts/build.py
```

### Build the .deb:

After you have a successfully built binary:
```bash
python ./build_scripts/create_deb.py
```

### Build the .rpm:

See RPM_BUILD.md


### Build the AppImage:
```bash
curl -L -o appimagetool-x86_64.AppImage https://github.com/AppImage/appimagetool/releases/download/continuous/appimagetool-x86_64.AppImage
chmod +x appimagetool-x86_64.AppImage
./appimagetool-x86_64.AppImage dist/ComicStripBrowser.AppDir
```

### Windows:

Since I had issues with PyInstaller and PyQt6 under Windows (GitHub Actions had, too) using the original `build_windows.bat`, the alternative was to use cx_Freeze. See [`build_windows_cxfreeze.bat`](./build_scripts/build_windows_cxfreeze.bat) and [`WINDOWS_BUILD.md`](./WINDOWS_BUILD.md).


## Known issues

### **Fractional scaling may lead to suboptimal rendering of the comics**

This is because such a scaling is performed externally, not by the app. Basically, an image is enlarged by the display server or by the window manager. While such a phenomenon is typically associated with X11, Deepin's Wayland-based Treeland is quite a failure in this regard. Compare the rendering in Deepin 25.0.1 with the out-of-the-box **125% desktop scaling** to the normal 100% scaling:

* [125% desktop scaling](./Screenshots/deepin_25_original_125_scaling.png)
* [100% desktop scaling](./Screenshots/deepin_25_reset_to_100_scaling.png)

Maximizing the window can help in some cases. In others, you might want to resize the window until a better rendering is obtained, if at all.

Otherwise, here's how the same comic strip looks by default in:

* [Linux Mint 22.1 Cinnamon](./Screenshots/Linux_Mint_22.1_Cinnamon.png)
* [Linux Mint 22.1 XFCE](./Screenshots/Linux_Mint_22.1_XFCE.png)
* [Ubuntu 25.04](./Screenshots/Ubuntu_25.04.png)
* [Kubuntu 25.10 snapshot2](./Screenshots/Kubuntu_25.10_snapshot2.png)

Note that the above screenshots were taken when the 15th comic title hadn't been added yet.

### **Cached images and logs**

The last-accessed 200 images for each comic title are stored in a folder called `cache`, which is too generic a name. Each comic title has its own subfolder, though.

The folder `cache` is saved as follows:

* In the current directory when possible, which happens if you launch the binary or the AppImage from a folder somewhere in your home.
* In $HOME when this is not possible, especially when installed globally from the `.deb` and launched from the menu.
* Beware that if you launch the app via a launcher triggered by Alt+F2, the current directory is `~/Desktop` in MATE and $HOME in other desktop environments.

The location should probably have been `~/.cache/comic-strip-browser/`.

### **Discover and AppStream**

I noticed that KDE Discover ignores the copyright file and claims there's no license in the `.deb`. Apparently, it expects all GUI packages to include AppStream metadata. I added such info in the `.deb`, but it's still ignored.

### **The AppImage**

The AppImage is, by all evidence, useless as long as it's basically a wrap around a fat binary created by PyInstaller. It doesn't hurt to have it, though.
